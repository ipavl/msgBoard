- FUNCTIONS. LOTS OF FUNCTIONS TO REDUCE REDUNANCY.
- move variable defining for viewing things to config so it's not redundant
- error checks / stop script on error (unless 'or die' does this):
	- postthread
- prevent/enforce protection against SQL injections/hacks:
	- possibly replace current sterilizing funcetion with
		mysql_real_escape_string(strip_tags(trim($_POST['frmUsername'])));
	
Retired / low priority:
	- make viewpost have 'scroll arrows' to go to prev/next post (hopefully seemlessly) -- Maybe not if using a normal thread/forum list
		- could maybe be re-introduced if single-post viewing is re-implemented
